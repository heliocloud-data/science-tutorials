    "# Guide to HelioCloud Tutorials\n",

    "\n",
    "There are many tutorials here in the GSFC HelioClound instance, and we'll help walk you through them. At this point we'll assume you're already in your account and able to run a Notebook.  We will walk you through an overview of SMCE, examples of data reads from AWS S3 storage, using Dask for compute power, and working in IDL.  We also include a link to a local copy of the PyHC summer school package tutorials for SunPy, SpacePy, AstroPy, HAPI, and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core HelioCloud notebooks to date are:\n",
    "1) basic file access of FITS, CDF and NetCDF data that is stored in AWS S3 cloud storage, in [S3-Access-Demo.ipynb](S3-Access-Demo.ipynb)\n",
    "2) 'bursting' a job onto multiple temporary CPUs in [Dask-Gateway-Example.ipynb](Dask-Gateway-Example.ipynb)\n",
    "3) combining accessing private or public S3 files with bursting via Dask in [S3-Dask-Demo.ipynb](S3-Dask-Demo.ipynb)\n",
    "4) finding datasets and lists of data files within one more more HelioClouds, in the [CloudCatalog-Demo.ipynb](CloudCatalog-Demo.ipynb)\n",
    "5) extended example MMS: searching for MMS data by instrument name and time range, then analyzing and plotting them, in [MMS-Catalog-Demo.ipynb](MMS-Catalog-Demo.ipynb)\n",
    "6) extended example SDO: searching for SDO data then processing a large set on multiple CPUs via Dask and gathering the results, in [HelioCloud-SDO-Demo.ipynb](HelioCloud-SDO-Demo.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "We start off with the 'Science in the Browser' approach where the Juptyer Notebook suffices to find, analyze and plot data entirely within the cloud.  We also include additional material for power users who prefer to work in their own cloud VM or cloud console environment."
